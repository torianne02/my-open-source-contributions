# Welcome! 

Hello 👋! If you've found this repository you already know that my name is Victoria Fluharty. What you probably don't know is that I go by **Tori**. 

Welcome to my open source contribution list! I have chosen to create this list of every open source pull request I have made here instead of endlessly listing them all on my resume. This way makes it easier for you to easily click the links and see my work. 🙃

## My Open Source Story

As a new developer I found contributing to open source very intimidating. 😱 It wasn't until October 2019, during [Hacktoberfest 🎃](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/), that I finally took a leap of faith and jumped into the world of the open source community. 

I wrote a blog post all about it, which you can find [here ✍️](https://dev.to/torianne02/hacktoberfest-getting-over-the-fear-of-open-source-41kg).
